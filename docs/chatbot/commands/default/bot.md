# !bot

The `!bot` command is used to manage the bot's behavior in the chat. It has three subcommands:

- `mute`: This subcommand is used to mute the bot, preventing it from sending messages in the chat.
- `unmute`: This subcommand is used to unmute the bot, allowing it to send messages in the chat again.
- `part`: This subcommand is used to make the bot leave the chat.

These commands are typically used by the streamer or moderators to control the bot's activity during a stream.

### Usage

```
!bot <subcommand>
```

### Example Input

```
!bot mute
```

### Example Output

```
:( / 
```
