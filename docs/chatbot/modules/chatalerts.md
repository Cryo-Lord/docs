# Chat Alerts

The chatalerts module is a feature that allows the chatbot to post messages in the chat when certain events occur. These events can include, but are not limited to:

- Receiving a tip
- Gaining a new follower
- Being raided
- Ad breaks
- New subscribers
- Cheers
- Loyalty redemptions
- Raids
- Hypetrains
- Polls
- Charity events

**How the module works:**

1. The module is activated when a specified event occurs.
2. Upon activation, the chatbot posts a predefined message in the chat to alert the streamer and the viewers of the event.
3. The message can be customized to include specific details about the event, such as the name of the new follower, the amount of the tip, or the details of the poll.

This module helps to acknowledge and appreciate the actions of the viewers, enhancing the interaction between the streamer and the viewers.
